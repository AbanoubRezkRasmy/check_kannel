INSTALL
-------

There is no automated install script yet, still install is quite easy.

1. Consult the README for dependencies.

2. Copy the check_kannel plugin in your Nagios plugin directory.
   Usually <nagios_home>/libexec/

3. Edit the plugin and substitute the
       use lib "/usr/local/nagios/plugins";
	line with the correct path for your install. This is the path where the
       utils.pm
   file is available, should be the direcotry in which you copied the plugin.

4. Define a check command in your Nagios configuration using check_kannel.

5. Have fun, report back issues and patches to me, luca<at>fantacast<dot>it.
