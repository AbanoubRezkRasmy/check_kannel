 check_kannel is a Nagios (http://www.nagios.org) plugin written in Perl
 (http://www.perl.org) which monitors the Kannel WAP and SMS Gateway software
 (http://www.kannel.org) status by interfacing with the status interface it
 exports in XML format via HTTP.
 
 It was coded mostly following guidelines on Nagios Plugin development found at

 http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html

 but currently lacks translation and performance data features.

 This plugin is currently in an initial development stage, however it is used in
 a Nagios production environment to test quite a few different Kannel setups
 doing real traffic.

 Requirements include:

    * Perl 5.
    * Nagios with EPN (Embedded Perl) support.
    * Perl modules:
       LWP::UserAgent XML::DOM XML::XPath XML::XPath::XMLParser Getopt::Long

 The following basic features were implemented:

    * Monitoring of Kannel Gateway operational status.
      Both gateway internal states and generic service reachability are tested.

    * Monitoring of Kannel SMSBOX and WAPBOX processes
      SMSBOX and WAPBOX connection to the core is tested if enabled by the user.

    * Monitoring of SMSCs status.
      Online status is checked. WARNING/CRITICAL states are reported based on
      specified number of active SMSCs.

    * Please note HTTPS checking was not tested.


 The following features are desirable (patches are welcome):

    * Monitoring of SMS and DLR queues/rate
      Number of SMS/DLR in the queues is checked. WARNING/CRITICAL states are
      reported based on specified number of queued SMS/DLR.

    * Monitoring of specific SMSC-IDs.

    * More general status.xml parsing engine (maybe Kannel::Status Perl module
      built on top of XML::Parser and XML::XPath).

    * Performance data reporting.

    * Language translation support.

    * Additional Nagios eventhandler using the Kannel Administrative interface over
      HTTP(S).

    * YOUR FEATURE HERE :)
